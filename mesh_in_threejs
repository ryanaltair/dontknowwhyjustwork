in threejs

point save as Vector3

then many points make a geometry

add material 

we get the real mesh

then use scene.add(mesh)

now we could see mesh

in mesh

veritices store in array

and face3 array 

keep data for how mesh's faces order

every face3 

get 3 point as vector3

to do: need to check is this order important

and a normal as vector3
